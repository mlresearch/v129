title: Exact Passive-Aggressive Algorithms for Multiclass Classification Using Bandit
  Feedbacks
crossref: acml20
abstract: In many real-life classification problems, we may not get exact class labels
  for training samples. One such example is bandit feedback in multiclass classification.
  In this setting, we only get to know whether our predicted label is correct or not.
  Due to which, we are left in uncertainty about the actual class label when we predict
  the wrong class. This paper proposes exact passive-aggressive online algorithms
  for multiclass classification under bandit feedback (EPABF). The proposed approach
  uses an exploration-exploitation strategy to guess the class label in every trial.
  To update the weights, we solve a quadratic optimization problem under multiple
  class separability constraints and find the exact solution. We do this by finding
  active constraints using the KKT conditions of the optimization problem. These constraints
  form a support set that determines the classes for which the weight vector needs
  to be updated. We propose three different variants of the weight update rule, which
  vary based on the aggressiveness to correct the mistake. These are called EPABF,
  EPABF-I, and EPABF-II. We also provide mistake bounds for the proposed EPABF, EPABF-I,
  and EPABF-II. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed algorithms perform better
  than other bandit feedback-based approaches and comparably to the full information
  approaches.
