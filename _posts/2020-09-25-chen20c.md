title: Learning Dynamic Context Graph Embedding
crossref: acml20
abstract: Graph embeddings represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors to preserve
  the proximity between nodes and communities of graphs for network analysis. The
  temporal edges (e.g., relationships, contacts, and emails) in dynamic graphs are
  important for graph evolution analysis, but few existing methods in graph embeddings
  can capture the dynamic information from temporal edges. In this study, we propose
  a dynamic graph embedding method to analyze the evolution patterns of dynamic graphs
  effectively. Our method uses diffuse context sampling to preserve the proximity
  between nodes, and applies dynamic context graph embeddings to train discrete-time
  graph embeddings in the same vector space without alignments to preserve the temporal
  continuity of stable nodes. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art
  methods for link prediction, and the experiments demonstrate that our method generally
  performs better at the task. Our method is further verified using a real-world dynamic
  graph by visualizing the evolution of its community structure at different timesteps.
