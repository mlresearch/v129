title: A foreground detection algorithm for Time-of-Flight cameras adapted dynamic
  integration time adjustment and multipath distortions
crossref: acml20
abstract: There are two scenarios often appear in the use of a Time-of-Flight (ToF)
  camera. One is requiring dynamic adjustment of its integration time to avoid overexposure,
  the other is multipath distortions happen. In these two scenarios, the pixel values
  of depth map and intensity map will suddenly and greatly change, and it will effect
  ToF based applications that require foreground detection. Traditional foreground
  detection algorithms can not adapt to these scenarios well, since they are sensitive
  to the sudden large change of pixel values and the threshold of pixel values difference
  people pick. Therefore, this paper proposes a pixel-insensitive and threshold-free
  algorithm to deal with the above scenarios. It is an end-to-end model based on deep
  learning. It takes two intensity maps captured by a ToF camera as input, where one
  intensity map works as a background, and the other works as a contrast. Taking their
  actual differences, also called foreground, as a label. Then, using deep learning
  to learn how to detect foreground based on these inputs and labels. To learn the
  pattern, datasets are collected under various scenes by multiple ToF cameras, and
  the training datasets are enlarged through applying a series of random transformations
  on the foreground and introducing two-dimensional Gaussian noise. Experiments show
  the new algorithm can stably detect foreground under different circumstances including
  the two mentioned scenarios.
