title: Learning 2-opt Heuristics for the Traveling Salesman Problem via Deep Reinforcement
  Learning
crossref: acml20
abstract: Recent works using deep learning to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem
  (TSP) have focused on learning construction heuristics. Such approaches find TSP
  solutions of good quality but require additional procedures such as beam search
  and sampling to improve solutions and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However,
  few studies have focused on improvement heuristics, where a given solution is improved
  until reaching a near-optimal one. In this work, we propose to learn a local search
  heuristic based on 2-opt operators via deep reinforcement learning. We propose a
  policy gradient algorithm to learn a stochastic policy that selects 2-opt operations
  given a current solution. Moreover, we introduce a policy neural network that leverages
  a pointing attention mechanism, which unlike previous works, can be easily extended
  to more general $k$-opt moves. Our results show that the learned policies can improve
  even over random initial solutions and approach near-optimal solutions at a faster
  rate than previous state-of-the-art deep learning methods.
