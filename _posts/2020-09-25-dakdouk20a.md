title: Collaborative Exploration in Stochastic Multi-Player Bandits
crossref: acml20
abstract: "Internet of Things (IoT) faces multiple challenges to achieve high reliability,
  low-latency and low power consumption.\r Its performance is affected by many factors
  such as external interference coming from other coexisting wireless communication
  technologies that are sharing the same spectrum.\r To address this problem, we introduce
  a general approach for the identification of poor-link quality channels.\r We formulate
  our problem as a multi-player multi-armed bandit problem, where the devices in an
  IoT network are the players, and the arms are the radio channels.\r For a realistic
  formulation, we do not assume that sensing information is available or that the
  number of players is below the number of arms.\r We develop and analyze a collaborative
  decentralized algorithm that aims to find a set of $m$ $(\\epsilon,m)$-optimal arms
  using an Explore-$m$  algorithm (as denoted by Kalyanakrishnan and Stone (2010))
  as a subroutine, and hence blacklisting the suboptimal arms in order to improve
  the QoS of IoT networks while reducing their energy consumption.\r We prove analytically
  and experimentally that our algorithm outperforms selfish algorithms in terms of
  sample complexity with a low communication cost, and that although playing a smaller
  set of arms increases the collision rate, playing the optimal arms only improves
  the QoS of the network."
