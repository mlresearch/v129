title: A Novel Higher-order Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Convolution
crossref: acml20
abstract: Current GNN architectures use a vertex neighborhood aggregation scheme,
  which limits their discriminative power to that of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman
  (WL) graph isomorphism test. Here, we propose a novel graph convolution operator
  that is based on the 2-dimensional WL test. We formally show that the resulting
  2-WL-GNN architecture is more discriminative than existing GNN approaches. This
  theoretical result is complemented by experimental studies using synthetic and real
  data. On multiple common graph classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that the
  proposed model is competitive with state-of-the-art graph kernels and GNNs.
