title: Bidirectional Dependency-Guided Attention for Relation Extraction
crossref: acml20
abstract: 'The dependency relation between words in the sentence is critical for the
  relation extraction. Existing methods often utilize the dependencies accompanied
  with various pruning strategies, thus suffer from the loss of detailed semantic
  information.In order to exploit dependency structure more effectively, we propose
  a novel bidirectional dependency-guided attention model. The main idea is to use
  a top-down attention as well as a bottom-up attention to fully capture the dependencies
  from different granularity. Specifically, the bottom-up attention aims to model
  the local semantics from the subtree of each node, while the top-down attention
  is to model the global semantics from the ancestor nodes. Moreover, we employ a
  label embedding component to attend the contextual features, which are extracted
  by the dependency-guided attention. Overall, the proposed model is fully attention-based
  which make it easy for parallel computing. Experiment results on TACRED dataset
  and SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset show that our model outperforms existing dependency
  based models as well as the powerful pretraining model. Moreover, the proposed model
  achieves the state-of-the-art performance on TACRED dataset.  '
