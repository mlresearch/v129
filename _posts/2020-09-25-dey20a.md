title: 'Deep-n-Cheap: An Automated Search Framework for Low Complexity Deep Learning'
crossref: acml20
abstract: We present Deep-n-Cheap – an open-source AutoML framework to search for
  deep learning models. This search includes both architecture and training hyperparameters,
  and supports convolutional neural networks and multilayer perceptrons. Our framework
  is targeted for deployment on both benchmark and custom datasets, and as a result,
  offers a greater degree of search space customizability as compared to a more limited
  search over only pre-existing models from literature. We also introduce the technique
  of ’search transfer’, which demonstrates the generalization capabilities of our
  models to multiple datasets. Deep-n-Cheap includes a user-customizable complexity
  penalty which trades off performance with training time or number of parameters.
  Specifically, our framework results in models offering performance comparable to
  state-of-the-art while taking 1-2 orders of magnitude less time to train than models
  from other AutoML and model search frameworks. Additionally, this work investigates
  and develops various insights regarding the search process. In particular, we show
  the superiority of a greedy strategy and justify our choice of Bayesian optimization
  as the primary search methodology over random / grid search.
