title: 'FIREPruning: Learning-based Filter Pruning for Convolutional Neural Network
  Compression'
crossref: acml20
abstract: Despite their great success in various fields, modern convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) require huge amount of computation in inference due to their deeper
  network structure, which prevents them from being used in resource-limited devices
  such as mobile phones and embedded sensors. Recently, filter pruning had been introduced
  as a promising model compression method to reduce computation cost and storage overhead.
  However, existing filter pruning approaches are mainly model-based, which rely on
  empirical model to evaluate the importance of filters and set parameters manually
  to guide model compression. In this paper, we observe that CNNs commonly consist
  of large amount of inactive filters, and introduce Filter Inactive RatE (FIRE),
  a novel metric to evaluate the importance of filters in a neural network. Based
  on FIRE, we develop a learning based filter pruning strategy called FIREPruning
  for fast model compression. It adopts a regression model to predict the FIRE value
  and uses a three stage pipeline (FIRE prediction, pruning, and fine-tuning) to compress
  the neural network efficiently. Extensive experiments based on widely-used CNN models
  and well-known datasets show that FIREPruning reduces overall computation cost up
  to 86.9% without sacrificing too much accuracy, which significantly outperforms
  the state-of-the-art model compression methods.
