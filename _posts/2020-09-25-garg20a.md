title: Robust Deep Ordinal Regression under Label Noise
crossref: acml20
abstract: The real-world data is often susceptible to label noise, which might constrict
  the effectiveness of the existing state of the art algorithms for ordinal regression.
  Existing works on ordinal regression do not take label noise into account. We propose
  a theoretically grounded approach for class conditional label noise in ordinal regression
  problems. We present a deep learning implementation of two commonly used loss functions
  for ordinal regression that is both - 1) robust to label noise, and 2) rank consistent
  for a good ranking rule. We verify these properties of the algorithm empirically
  and show robustness to label noise on real data and rank consistency. To the best
  of our knowledge, this is the first approach for robust ordinal regression models.
