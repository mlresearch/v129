title: 'CCA-Flow: Deep Multi-view Subspace Learning with Inverse Autoregressive Flow'
crossref: acml20
abstract: Multi-view subspace learning aims to learn a shared representation from
  multiple sources or views of an entity. The learned representation enables reconstruction
  of common patterns of multi-view data, which helps dimensional reduction, exploratory
  data analysis, missing view completion, and various downstream tasks. However, existing
  methods often use simple structured approximations of the posterior of shared latent
  variables for the sake of computational efficiency. Such oversimplified models have
  a huge impact on the inference quality and can hurt the representation power. To
  this end, we propose a new method for multi-view subspace learning that achieves
  efficient Bayesian inference with strong representation power. Our method, coined
  CCA-Flow, bases on variational Canonical Correlation Analysis and models the inference
  network as an Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF). With the flow-based variational
  inference imposed on the latent variables, the posterior approximations can be arbitrarily
  complex and flexible, and the model can still be efficiently trained with stochastic
  gradient descent. Experiments on three benchmark multi-view datasets show that our
  model gives improved representations of shared latent variables and has superior
  performance against previous works.
