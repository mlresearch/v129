title: Enhancing Topic Models by Incorporating Explicit and Implicit External Knowledge
crossref: acml20
abstract: 'Topic models are widely used for extracting latent features from documents.
  Conventional count-based models like LDA focus on co-occurrence of words, neglecting
  features like semantics and lexical relations in the corpora. To overcome this drawback,
  many knowledge-enhanced models are proposed, attempting to achieve better topic
  coherence with external knowledge. In this paper, we present novel probabilistic
  topic models utilizing both explicit and implicit knowledge forms. Knowledge of
  real-world entities in a knowledge base/graph are referred to as explicit knowledge.
  We incorporate this knowledge form into our models by entity linking, a technique
  for bridging the gap between corpora and knowledge bases. This helps solving the
  problem of token/phrase-level synonymy and polysemy. Apart from explicit knowledge,
  we utilize latent feature word representations (implicit knowledge) to further capture
  lexical relations in pretraining corpora. Qualitative and Quantitative evaluations
  are conducted on 2 datasets with 5 baselines (3 probabilistic models and 2 neural
  models). Our models exhibit high potential in generating coherent topics. Remarkably,
  when adopting both explicit and implicit knowledge, our proposed model even outperforms
  2 state-of-the-art neural topic models, suggesting that knowledge-enhancement can
  highly improve the performance of conventional topic models. '
