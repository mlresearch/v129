title: Partially Observable Markov Decision Process Modelling for Assessing Hierarchies
crossref: acml20
abstract: Hierarchical clustering has been shown to be valuable in many scenarios.
  Despite its usefulness to many situations, there is no agreed methodology on how
  to properly evaluate the hierarchies produced from different techniques, particularly
  in the case where ground-truth labels are unavailable. This motivates us to propose
  a framework for assessing the quality of hierarchical clustering allocations which
  covers the case of no ground-truth information. This measurement is useful, e.g.,
  to assess the hierarchical structures used by online retailer websites to display
  their product catalogues. Our framework is one of the few attempts for the hierarchy
  evaluation from a decision theoretic perspective. We model the process as a bot
  searching stochastically for items in the hierarchy and establish a measure representing
  the degree to which the hierarchy supports this search. We employ Partially Observable
  Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to model the uncertainty, the decision making,
  and the cognitive return for searchers in such a scenario.
