title: Foolproof Cooperative Learning
crossref: acml20
abstract: 'This paper extends the notion of learning algorithms and learning equilibriums
  from repeated games theory to stochastic games. We introduce Foolproof Cooperative
  Learning (FCL), an algorithm that converges to an equilibrium strategy that allows
  cooperative strategies in self-play setting while being not exploitable by selfish
  learners. By construction, FCL is a learning equilibrium for repeated symmetric
  games. We illustrate the behavior of FCL on symmetric matrix and grid games, and
  its robustness to selfish learners. '
