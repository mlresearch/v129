title: Bridging Ordinary-Label Learning and Complementary-Label Learning
crossref: acml20
abstract: A supervised learning framework has been proposed for the situation where
  each trainingdata is provided with a complementary label that represents a class
  to which the pattern does not belong. In the existing literature, complementary-label
  learning has been studied independently from ordinary-label learning, which assumes
  that each training data is provided with a label representing the class to which
  the pattern belongs.  However, providing a complementary label should be treated
  as equivalent to providing the rest of all the labels as the candidates of the one
  true class. In this paper, we focus on the fact that the loss functions for one-versus-all
  and pairwise classification corresponding to ordinary-label learning and complementary-label
  learning satisfy certain additivity and duality, and provide a framework which directly
  bridge those existing supervised learning frameworks. Further, we derive classification
  risk and error bound for any loss functions which satisfy additivity and duality.
