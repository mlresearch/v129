title: 'DFQF: Data Free Quantization-aware Fine-tuning'
crossref: acml20
abstract: Data free deep neural network quantization is a practical challenge, since
  the original training data is often unavailable due to some privacy, proprietary
  or transmission issues. The existing methods implicitly equate data-free with training-free
  and quantize model manually through analyzing the weightsâ€™ distribution. It leads
  to a significant accuracy drop in lower than 6-bit quantization. In this work, we
  propose the data free quantization-aware fine-tuning (DFQF), wherein no real training
  data is required, and the quantized network is fine-tuned with generated images.
  Specifically, we start with training a generator from the pre-trained full-precision
  network with inception score loss, batch-normalization statistics loss and adversarial
  loss to synthesize a fake image set. Then we fine-tune the quantized student network
  with the full-precision teacher network and the generated images by utilizing knowledge
  distillation (KD). The proposed DFQF outperforms state-of-the-art post-train quantization
  methods, and achieve W4A4 quantization of ResNet20 on the CIFAR10 dataset within
  1% accuracy drop.
