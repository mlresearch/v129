title: Scalable Calibration of Affinity Matrices from Incomplete Observations
crossref: acml20
abstract: Estimating pairwise affinity matrices for given data samples is a basic
  problem in data processing applications. Accurately determining the affinity becomes
  impossible when the samples are not fully observed and approximate estimations have
  to be sought. In this paper, we investigated calibration approaches to improve the
  quality of an approximate affinity matrix. By projecting the matrix onto a closed
  and convex subset of matrices that meets specific constraints, the calibrated result
  is guaranteed to get nearer to the unknown true affinity matrix than the un-calibrated
  matrix, except in rare cases they are identical. To realize the calibration, we
  developed two simple, efficient, and yet effective algorithms that scale well. One
  algorithm applies cyclic updates and the other algorithm applies parallel updates.
  In a series of evaluations, the empirical results justified the theoretical benefits
  of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrated their high potential in practical applications.
