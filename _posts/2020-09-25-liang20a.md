title: Atlas-aware ConvNet for Accurate yet Robust Anatomical Segmentation
crossref: acml20
abstract: "Convolutional networks (ConvNets) have achieved promising accuracy for
  various anatomical segmentation tasks. Despite the success, these methods can be
  sensitive to  appearance variations that unforeseen from the training distributions.
  Considering the large variability of scans caused by artifacts, pathologies, and
  scanning setups, the robustness of ConvNets poses as a major challenge for their
  clinical applications, yet has not been much explored. In this paper, we propose
  to mitigate the challenge by enabling ConvNetsâ€™ awareness of the underlying anatomical
  invariances among imaging scans. Specifically, we introduce a fully convolutional
  Constraint Adoption Module (CAM) that incorporates probabilistic atlas priors as
  explicit constraints for predictions over a locally connected Conditional Random
  Field (CFR), which effectively reinforces the anatomical consistency of the labeling
  outputs. We design the CAM to be flexible for boosting various ConvNet, and compact
  for co-optimizing with ConvNets for fusion parameters that leads to the optimal
  performance. We show the advantage of such atlas priors fusion is two-fold with
  two brain parcellation tasks.\r First, our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy
  among ConvNet-based methods on both datasets, by significantly reducing structural
  abnormalities of predictions. Second, we can largely boost the robustness of existing
  ConvNets, proved by: (i) testing on scans with synthetic pathologies, and (ii) training
  and evaluation on scans of different scanning setups across datasets. Our method
  is proposing to be easily adopted to existing ConvNets by fine-tuning with CAM plugged
  in for accuracy and robustness boosts. "
