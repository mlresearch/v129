title: Network Representation Learning Algorithm Based on Neighborhood Influence Sequence
crossref: acml20
abstract: Network representation learning (NRL) is playing an important role in network
  analysis, aiming to represent complex network more concisely by transforming nodes
  into low-dimensional vectors. However, most of the current work only uses network
  structure and node attribute to learn network representation, and often ignores
  the historical interactions between nodes that will affect the future interactions.
  Therefore, we propose a network representation learning algorithm based on neighborhood
  influence sequence (NIS), by investigating the influence of node historical interactions
  on future interactions. We propose three kinds of influence when two nodes interact,
  and integrate them into NIS by introducing the Hawkes process. In experiments, we
  compare our model with existing NRL models on four real-world datasets. Experimental
  results demonstrate that the embedding learned from the proposed NIS model achieve
  better performance than state-of-the-art methods in various tasks including node
  classification, link prediction, and network visualization.
