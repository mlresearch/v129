title: 'Localizing and Amortizing: Efficient Inference for Gaussian Processes'
crossref: acml20
abstract: The inference of Gaussian Processes concerns the distribution of the underlying
  function given observed data points. GP inference based on local ranges of data
  points is able to capture fine-scale correlations and allow fine-grained decomposition
  of the computation. Following this direction, we propose a new inference model that
  considers the correlations and observations of the K nearest neighbors for the inference
  at a data point. Compared with previous works, we also eliminate the data ordering
  prerequisite to simplify the inference process. Additionally, the inference task
  is decomposed to small subtasks with several technique innovations, making our model
  well suits the stochastic optimization. Since the decomposed small subtasks have
  the same structure, we further speed up the inference procedure with amortized inference.
  Our model runs efficiently and achieves good performances on several benchmark tasks.
