title: 'MetAL: Active Semi-Supervised Learning on Graphs via Meta-Learning'
crossref: acml20
abstract: The objective of active learning (AL) is to train classification models
  with less labeled instances by selecting only the most informative instances for
  labeling. The AL algorithms designed for other data types such as images and text
  do not perform well on graph-structured data. Although a few heuristics-based AL
  algorithms have been proposed for graphs, a principled approach is lacking. In this
  paper, we propose MetAL, an AL approach that selects unlabeled instances that directly
  improve the future performance of a classification model. For a semi-supervised
  learning problem, we formulate the AL task as a bilevel optimization problem. Based
  on recent work in meta-learning, we use the meta-gradients to approximate the impact
  of retraining the model with any unlabeled instance on the model performance. Using
  multiple graph datasets belonging to different domains, we demonstrate that MetAL
  efficiently outperforms existing state-of-the-art AL algorithms.
