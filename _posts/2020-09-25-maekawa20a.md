title: Data-Dependent Conversion to a Compact Integer-Weighted Representation of a
  Weighted  Voting Classifier
crossref: acml20
abstract: 'We propose a method of converting a real-weighted  voting classifier to
  a compact integer-weighted  voting classifier. Real-weighted  voting classifiers
  like those trained using boosting are very popular and widely used due to their
  high prediction performance. Real numbers, however,  are space-consuming and its
  floating-point arithmetic is slow compared to integer arithmetic, so compact integer
  weights are preferable for implementation on devices with small computational resources.
  Our conversion makes use of given feature vectors and solves an integer linear programming
  problem that minimizes the sum of integer weights under the constraint of keeping
  the classification result for the vectors unchanged. According to our experimental
  results using datasets of UCI Machine Learning Repository, the bit representation
  sizes are reduced to $5.2$-$33.4$% within $3.7$% test accuracy degrade in 7 of 8
  datasets for the weighted  voting classifiers of decision stumps learned using AdaBoost-SAMME. '
