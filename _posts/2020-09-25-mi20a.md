title: Learning Code Changes by Exploiting Bidirectional Converting Deviation
crossref: acml20
abstract: Software systems evolve with constant code changes when requirements change
  or bugs are found. Assessing the quality of code change is a vital part of software
  development. However, most existing software mining methods inspect software data
  from a static view and learn global code semantics from a snapshot of code, which
  cannot capture the semantic information of small changes and are under{-}representation
  for rich historical code changes. How to build a model to emphasize the code change
  remains a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network
  called CCL, which models a forward converting process from the code before change
  to the code after change and a backward converting process inversely, and the change
  representations of bidirectional converting processes can be learned. By exploiting
  the deviation of the converting processes, the code change can be evaluated by the
  network. Experimental results on open source projects indicate that CCL significantly
  outperforms the compared methods in code change learning.
