title: Theory of Mind with Guilt Aversion Facilitates Cooperative Reinforcement Learning
crossref: acml20
abstract: Guilt aversion induces experience of a utility loss in people if they believe
  they have disappointed others, and this promotes cooperative behaviour in human.
  In psychological game theory, guilt aversion necessitates modelling of agents that
  have theory about what other agents think, also known as Theory of Mind (ToM). We
  aim to build a new kind of affective reinforcement learning agents, called Theory
  of Mind Agents with Guilt Aversion (ToMAGA), which are equipped with an ability
  to think about the wellbeing of others instead of just self-interest. To validate
  the agent design, we use a general-sum game known as Stag Hunt as a test bed. As
  standard reinforcement learning agents could learn suboptimal policies in social
  dilemmas like Stag Hunt, we propose to use belief-based guilt aversion as a reward
  shaping mechanism. We show that our belief-based guilt averse agents can efficiently
  learn cooperative behaviours in Stag Hunt Games.
