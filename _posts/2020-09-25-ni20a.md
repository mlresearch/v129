title: 'PSForest: Improving Deep Forest via Feature Pooling and Error Screening'
crossref: acml20
abstract: In recent years, most of the research on deep learning is based on deep
  neural networks, which uses the backpropagation algorithm to train parameters of
  nonlinear layers. Recently, a non-NN style deep model called Deep Forest or gcForest
  was proposed by Zhou and Feng, which is a deep learning model based on random forests
  and the training process does not rely on backpropagation. In this paper, we propose
  PSForest, which can be regarded as a modification of the standard Deep Forest. The
  main idea for improving the efficiency and performance of the Deep Forest is to
  do multi-grained pooling of raw features and screening the class vector of each
  layer based on out-of-bag error. The experiment on different datasets shows that
  our proposed model achieves predictive accuracy comparable to or better than gcForest,
  with lower memory requirement and smaller time cost. The study significantly improves
  the competitiveness of deep forests, further demonstrating that deep learning is
  more than just deep neural networks.
