title: Randomness Efficient Feature Hashing for Sparse Binary Data
crossref: acml20
abstract: "We present sketching algorithms for sparse binary datasets, which maintain
  \   binary version of the dataset after sketching,   while simultaneously preserving
  multiple similarity measures such as Jaccard Similarity, Cosine Similarity, Inner
  Product, and Hamming Distance, on the same sketch. A major advantage of our algorithms
  is that\r they are randomness efficient, and require significantly less number of
  random bits for sketching â€“ logarithmic in   dimension, while other competitive
  algorithms require linear in   dimension. Our proposed algorithms are   efficient,
  \ offer a compact sketch of the dataset, and can be efficiently deployed in a distributive
  setting. We present a theoretical analysis of our approach and complement them with
  extensive experimentations on public datasets. For analysis purposes, our algorithms
  require a natural assumption on the dataset.   We empirically verify  the assumption
  and notice that it  holds on several  real-world datasets."
