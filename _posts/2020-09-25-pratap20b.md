title: Scaling up Simhash
crossref: acml20
abstract: "The seminal work of (Charikar, 2002) gives a space efficient sketching
  algorithm (Simhash) which compresses real-valued vectors to binary vectors while
  maintaining an estimate of the  Cosine similarity between any pairs of original
  real-valued vectors.  In this work, we propose a sketching algorithm – Simsketch
  – that can be applied on top of the results obtained from Simhash. This further
  reduces the data dimension while maintaining an estimate of the  Cosine similarity
  between original real-valued vectors. As a consequence, it helps in scaling up the
  performance of Simhash. We present  theoretical bounds of our result and complement
  it with experimentation on public datasets. Our proposed algorithm is simple, efficient,
  and therefore can be adopted in practice.\r "
