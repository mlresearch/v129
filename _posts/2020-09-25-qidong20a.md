title: 'A New Representation Learning Method for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation:
  Split Covariate Representation Network'
crossref: acml20
abstract: "Individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation is widely used in many essential
  fields, such as medical and education. But two problems, unknown counterfactual
  outcome and confounder, are the barriers for making a good ITE estimation. Although
  some representation learning methods based on potential outcome framework have been
  proposed to solve the problems, we find that most of previous works assume all features
  (also named covariate) of a unit are confounders. However, this assumption is not
  easy to become true, because instrument variables, adjustment variables and irrelevant
  variables can also be included in\r features. Therefore, this paper proposes a simple
  method to split covariates, and then a network, Split Covariate Representation Network
  (SCRNet), is mentioned, which is used to estimate ITE by different kinds of variables.
  Experiment results show that our method outperforms other state-of-arts methods
  on IHDP, a semi-synthetic dataset, and Jobs, a real-world dataset."
