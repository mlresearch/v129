title: A State Aggregation Approach for Solving Knapsack Problem with Deep Reinforcement
  Learning
crossref: acml20
abstract: This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for solving
  knapsack problem. The proposed method consists of a state aggregation step based
  on tabular reinforcement learning to extract features and construct states. The
  state aggregation policy is applied to each problem instance of the knapsack problem,
  which is used with Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) algorithm to train a policy through
  which the items are sequentially selected at each time step. The method is a constructive
  solution approach and the process of selecting items is repeated until the final
  solution is obtained. The experiments show that our approach provides close to optimal
  solutions for all tested instances, outperforms the greedy algorithm, and is able
  to handle larger instances and more flexible than an existing DRL approach. In addition,
  the results demonstrate that the proposed model with the state aggregation strategy
  not only gives better solutions but also learns in less timesteps, than the one
  without state aggregation.
