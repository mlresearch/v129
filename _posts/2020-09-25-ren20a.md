title: Semantic-Guided Shared Feature Alignment for Occluded Person Re-IDentification
crossref: acml20
abstract: 'Occluded Person Re-ID is a challenging task under resolved. Instead of
  extracting features over the entire image which would easily cause mismatching,
  we propose Semantic-Guided Shared Feature Alignment (SGSFA)  method to extract features
  focusing on the non-occluded parts. SGSFA parses human body regions through Semantic
  Guided (SG) branch and aligns regions through Spatial Feature Alignment (SFA) branch
  simultaneously, and gets enriched representations over the regions for Re-ID. Dynamic
  classification loss of spatial features and their dynamical sequential combinations
  in the training stage help facilitate feature diversity. During the matching stage,
  we use only the visible feature shared by probe and gallery with no extra cues.
  The experiment results show that SGSFA achieves rank-1 of 62.3% and 50.5% respectively
  for Occluded-DukeMTMC and P-DukeMTMC-reID, surpassing the state-of-the-art by a
  large margin. '
