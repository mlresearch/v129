title: Polytime Decomposition of Generalized Submodular Base Polytopes with Efficient
  Sampling
crossref: acml20
abstract: We consider the problem of efficient decomposition of a given point $x$
  in an $n$-dimensional convex polytope into convex combination of its extreme points.
  Besides the widespread scopes of the problem in theory of convex polytopes in mathematics,
  the problem also has applications in online combinatorial optimization problems.
  Towards this we first propose a general class of convex polytopes–Generalized Submodular
  Base Polytopes (GSBPs)–that includes several well known convex polytopes as its
  special case including permutahedron, $k$-forest, spanning tree, combinatorial subset
  choice polytopes. We next propose a general decomposition algorithm for above class
  of GSBPs that uses the novel idea of first decomposing the given point into at most
  $n$ \emph{face centers}, and further decomposing each face center into \emph{extreme
  points} of their corresponding faces. In addition, we discover a few special class
  of \emph{partition-respecting} and \emph{symmetric} GSBPs for which the above two
  steps could be performed in respectively $O(n^2 + nT(f))$ and $O(n^2T(f))$ time.
  We also give a complete characterization of the underlying submodular function $f$,
  for which the associated GSBP satisfies the above properties. One interesting fact
  is we show that the support of the resulting decomposition with our proposed algorithm
  is only $poly(n)$ in the number of extreme points which respects \emph{efficient
  sampling} from the resulting distribution. Finally we corroborate our theoretical
  results with empirical evaluations.
