title: 'Run2Survive: A Decision-theoretic Approach to Algorithm Selection based on
  Survival Analysis'
crossref: acml20
abstract: Algorithm selection (AS) deals with the automatic selection of an algorithm
  from a fixed set of candidate algorithms most suitable for a specific instance of
  an algorithmic problem class, where “suitability” often refers to an algorithm’s
  runtime.  Due to possibly extremely long runtimes of candidate algorithms, training
  data for algorithm selection models is usually generated under time constraints
  in the sense that not all algorithms are run to completion on all instances. Thus,
  training data usually comprises censored information, as the true runtime of algorithms
  timed out remains unknown. However, many standard AS approaches are not able to
  handle such information in a proper way. On the other side, survival  analysis (SA)
  naturally supports censored data and offers appropriate ways to use such data for
  learning distributional models of algorithm runtime, as we demonstrate in this work.
  We leverage such models as a basis of a sophisticated decision-theoretic approach
  to algorithm selection, which we dub Run2Survive. Moreover, taking advantage of
  a framework of this kind, we advocate a risk-averse approach to algorithm selection,
  in which the avoidance of a timeout is given high priority. In an extensive experimental
  study with the standard benchmark ASlib, our approach is shown to be highly competitive
  and in many cases even superior to state-of-the-art AS approaches.
