title: Learning from Label Proportions with Consistency Regularization
crossref: acml20
abstract: The problem of learning from label proportions (LLP) involves training classifiers
  with weak labels on bags of instances, rather than strong labels on individual instances.
  The weak labels only contain the label proportion of each bag. The LLP problem is
  important for many practical applications that only allow label proportions to be
  collected because of data privacy or annotation cost, and has recently received
  lots of research attention. Most existing works focus on extending supervised learning
  models to solve the LLP problem, but the weak learning nature makes it hard to further
  improve LLP performance with a supervised angle. In this paper, we take a different
  angle from semi-supervised learning. In particular, we propose a novel model inspired
  by consistency regularization, a popular concept in semi-supervised learning that
  encourages the model to produce a decision boundary that better describes the data
  manifold. With the introduction of consistency regularization, we further extend
  our study to non-uniform bag-generation and validation-based parameter-selection
  procedures that better match practical needs. Experiments not only justify that
  LLP with consistency regularization achieves superior performance, but also demonstrate
  the practical usability of the proposed procedures.
