title: Thompson Sampling for Unsupervised Sequential Selection
crossref: acml20
abstract: Thompson Sampling has generated significant interest due to its better empirical
  performance than upper confidence bound based algorithms. In this paper, we study
  Thompson Sampling based algorithm for Unsupervised Sequential Selection (USS) problem.
  The USS problem is a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandits problem, where
  the loss of an arm can not be inferred from the observed feedback. In the USS setup,
  arms are associated with fixed costs and are ordered, forming a cascade. In each
  round, the learner selects an arm and observes the feedback from arms up to the
  selected arm. The learner’s goal is to find the arm that minimizes the expected
  total loss. The total loss is the sum of the cost incurred for selecting the arm
  and the stochastic loss associated with the selected arm. The problem is challenging
  because, without knowing the mean loss, one cannot compute the total loss for the
  selected arm. Clearly, learning is feasible only if the optimal arm can be inferred
  from the problem structure. As shown in the prior work, learning is possible when
  the problem instance satisfies the so-called ‘Weak Dominance’ (WD) property. Under
  WD, we show that our Thompson Sampling based algorithm for the USS problem achieves
  near optimal regret and has better numerical performance than existing algorithms.
