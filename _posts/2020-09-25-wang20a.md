title: Deep Dynamic Boosted Forest
crossref: acml20
abstract: Random forest is widely exploited as an ensemble learning method. In many
  practical applications, however, there is still a significant challenge to learn
  from imbalanced data. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a deep dynamic boosted
  forest (DDBF), a novel ensemble algorithm that incorporates the notion of hard example
  mining into random forest. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we propose to measure the quality of each
  leaf node of every decision tree in the random forest to determine hard examples.
  By iteratively training and then removing easy examples from training data, we evolve
  the random forest to focus on hard examples dynamically so as to balance the proportion
  of samples and learn decision boundaries better. Data can be cascaded through these
  random forests learned in each iteration in sequence to generate more accurate predictions.
  Our DDBF outperforms random forest on 5 UCI datasets, MNIST and SATIMAGE, and achieved
  state-of-the-art results compared to other deep models. Moreover, we show that DDBF
  is also a new way of sampling and can be very useful and efficient when learning
  from imbalanced data.
