title: Inferring Continuous Treatment Doses from Historical Data via Model-Based Entropy-Regularized
  Reinforcement Learning
crossref: acml20
abstract: Developments in Reinforcement Learning and the availability of healthcare
  data sources such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) provide an opportunity to derive
  data-driven treatment dose recommendations for patients and improve clinical outcomes.
  Recent studies have focused on deriving discretized dosages using offline historical
  data extracted from EHR. In this paper, we propose an Actor-Critic framework to
  infer continuous dosage for treatment recommendation and demonstrate its advantage
  in numerical stability as well as interpretability. In addition, we incorporate
  a Bayesian Neural Network as a simulation model and probability-based regularization
  techniques to alleviate the distribution shift in off-line learning environments
  to increase practical safety. Experiments on a real-world EHR data set, MIMIC-III,
  show that our approach can achieve improved performance while maintaining similarity
  to expert clinician treatments in comparison to other baseline methods.
