title: Robust Document Distance with Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric
crossref: acml20
abstract: Computing the distance among linguistic objects is an essential problem
  in natural language processing. The word moverâ€™s distance (WMD) has been successfully
  applied to measure the document distance by synthesizing the low-level word similarity
  with the framework of optimal transport (OT). However, due to the global transportation
  nature of OT, the WMD may overestimate the semantic dissimilarity when documents
  contain unequal semantic details. In this paper, we propose to address this overestimation
  issue with a novel Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) document distance grounded on unbalanced
  optimal transport theory. Compared to the WMD, the WFR document distance provides
  a trade-off between global transportation and local truncation, which leads to a
  better similarity measure for unequal semantic details. Moreover, an efficient prune
  strategy is particularly designed for the WFR document distance to facilitate the
  top-k queries among a large number of documents. Extensive experimental results
  show that the WFR document distance achieves higher accuracy that WMD and even its
  supervised variation s-WMD.
