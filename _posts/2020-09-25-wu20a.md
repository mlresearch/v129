title: Towards Understanding and Improving the Transferability of Adversarial Examples
  in Deep Neural Networks
crossref: acml20
abstract: 'Currently it is well known that deep neural networks are vulnerable to
  adversarial examples, constructed by applying small but malicious perturbations
  to the original inputs. Moreover, the perturbed inputs can transfer between different
  models: adversarial examples generated based on a specific model will often fool
  other unseen models with a significant success rate. This allows the adversary to
  leverage it to attack the deployed systems without any query, which could raise
  severe security issue particularly in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we
  empirically investigate two classes of factors that might influence the transferability
  of adversarial examples. One is about model-specific factors, including network
  architecture, model capacity and test accuracy. The other is the local smoothness
  of loss surface for generating adversarial examples. More importantly, relying on
  these findings on the transferability of adversarial examples, we propose a simple
  but effective strategy to improve the transferability, whose effectiveness is confirmed
  through extensive experiments on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.'
