title: Proxy Network for Few Shot Learning
crossref: acml20
abstract: The use of a few examples for each class to train a predictive model that
  can be generalizedto novel classes is a crucial and valuable research direction
  in artificial intelligence.  Thiswork addresses this problem by proposing a few-shot
  learning (FSL) algorithm called proxynetwork under the architecture of meta-learning.  Metric-learning
  based approaches assumethat  the  data  points  within  the  same  class  should  be  close,  whereas  the  data  points  inthe
  different  classes should be separated as  far as possible in the embedding space.  Weconclude
  that the success of metric-learning based approaches lies in the data embedding,the  representative  of  each  class,  and  the  distance  metric.   In  this  work,  we  propose  asimple
  but effective end-to-end model that directly learns proxies for class representativeand  distance  metric  from  data  simultaneously.   We  conduct  experiments  on  CUB  andmini-ImageNet
  datasets in 1-shot-5-way and 5-shot-5-way scenarios, and the experimentalresults
  demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.Besides,
  we provide a detailed analysis of our proposed method.
