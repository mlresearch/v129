title: Disentangled Representations for Sequence Data using Information Bottleneck
  Principle
crossref: acml20
abstract: 'We propose the factorizing variational autoencoder (FAVAE), a generative
  model for learning dis- entangled representations from sequential data via the information
  bottleneck principle without supervision. Real-world data are often generated by
  a few explanatory factors of variation, and disentangled representation learning
  obtains these factors from the data. We focus on the disen- tangled representation
  of sequential data which can be useful in a wide range of applications, such as
  video, speech, and stock markets. Factors in sequential data are categorized into
  dynamic and static ones: dynamic factors are time dependent, and static factors
  are time independent. Previous models disentangle between static and dynamic factors
  and between dynamic factors with different time dependencies by explicitly modeling
  the priors of latent variables. However, these models cannot disentangle representations
  between dynamic factors with the same time dependency, such as disentangling “picking
  up” and “throwing” in robotic tasks. On the other hand, FAVAE can disentangle multiple
  dynamic factors via the information bottleneck principle where it does not require
  modeling priors. We conducted experiments to show that FAVAE can extract disentangled
  dynamic factors on synthetic, video, and speech datasets.'
