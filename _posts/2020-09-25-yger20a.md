title: Geodesically-convex optimization for averaging partially observed covariance
  matrices
crossref: acml20
abstract: Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices permeates numerous scientific
  disciplines, including machine learning, optimization, and signal processing. Equipped
  with a Riemannian geometry, the space of SPD matrices benefits from compelling properties
  and its derived Riemannian mean is now the gold standard in some applications, e.g.
  brain-computer interfaces (BCI). This paper addresses the problem of averaging covariance
  matrices with missing variables. This situation often occurs with inexpensive or
  unreliable sensors, or when artifact-suppression techniques remove corrupted sensors
  leading to rank deficient matrices, hindering the use of the Riemannian geometry
  in covariance-based approaches. An alternate but questionable method consists in
  removing the matrices with missing variables, thus reducing the training set size.
  We address those limitations and propose a new formulation grounded in geodesic
  convexity. Our approach is evaluated on generated datasets with a controlled number
  of missing variables and a known baseline, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed
  estimator. The practical interest of this approach is assessed on real BCI datasets.
  Our results show that the proposed average is more robust and better suited for
  classification than classical data imputation methods.
