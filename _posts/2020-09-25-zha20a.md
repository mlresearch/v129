title: Efficient Attention Calibration Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation
crossref: acml20
abstract: In recent years, the attention mechanism has been widely used in computer
  vision. Semantic segmentation, as one of the fundamental tasks of computer vision,
  has been subject to tremendous development as a result. But because of its huge
  computing overhead, attention-based approaches are difficult to use for real-time
  applications such as self-driving. In this paper, we propose a self-calibration
  method baesd on self-attentiion that successfully applies the attention mechanism
  to real-time semantic segmentation. Specifically, a spatial attention module to
  adjust the edges of the coarse segmentation results which gained from the real-time
  semantic segmentation backbone network, and obtain more granular segmentation results.
  We refer to this method as the Efficient Attentional Calibration Network (EACNet).
  Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset validate the efficiency and performance of
  the method. With the high-resolution input and without any post-processing, EACNet
  achieved 72.4% mIoU of accuracy while running at 116.9 FPS. Compared to other state-of-the-art
  methods for real-time semantic segmentation, our network gained a better balance
  between performance and speed.
