title: 'Dual Learning: Theoretical Study and an Algorithmic Extension'
crossref: acml20
abstract: 'Dual learning has been successfully applied in many machine learning applications
  including machine translation, image-to-image transformation, etc. The high-level
  idea of dual learning is very intuitive: if we map an $x$ from one domain to another
  and then map it back, we should recover the original $x$. Although its effectiveness
  has been empirically verified, theoretical understanding of dual learning is still
  very limited. In this paper, we aim at understanding why and when dual learning
  works. Based on our theoretical analysis, we further extend dual learning by introducing
  more related mappings and propose multi-step dual learning, in which we leverage
  feedback signals from additional domains to improve the qualities of the mappings.
  We prove that multi-step dual learning can boost the performance of standard dual
  learning under mild conditions. Experiments on WMT 14 English↔German and MultiUN
  English↔French translations verify our theoretical findings on dual learning, and
  the results on the translations among English, French, and Spanish of MultiUN demonstrate
  the effectiveness of multi-step dual learning'
